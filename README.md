# Fine-grained-image-recognition
---
This repo contains training code for fgvc tasks of 3 dataset. 
This implementation achieves comparable state-of-the-art results.

Fine-grained-image-recognition is a classification task where sub-category visual differences are small and can be overwhelmed by factors such as pose, viewpoint, or location of the object in the image e.g., species of birds or models of cars. The small inter-class variations and the large intra-class variations caused by the fine-grained nature makes it a challenging problem. During the booming of deep learning, recent years have witnessed remarkablen progress of FGIA using deep learning techniques.
